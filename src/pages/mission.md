The goal of this blog is to talk about sexual issues that men commonly experience. In the tagline for the site 

> Talking about the secret most men have but won't share
    
I share my belief that most men have aspects of their sexuality that they are ashamed of, feel they cannot share for fear of being discovered, and remain stuck in their struggles. The truth is that these issues are commonly experienced by most men. 

But why here? In my experience, the kind of issues I will be discussing here are either 
* not being talked about elsewhere, where you might reasonably expect them to be (ie. a church). 
* not being talked about constructively, due to lack of honest, transparent community 
* or not being dealt with effectively, due to lack of experience with lasting change.

My hope is that this blog will play a part in enabling men to talk about their sexual issues honestly with other men, in a way that builds community, dissipates the shame, and leads to person freedom.

Let's begin the discussion.
