So maybe you are having a private struggle but you are wondering if it is a _real_ problem. With so much silence around the issue, and without anyone to share with, it is hard to tell and tough to be honest with ourselves; ultimately it is a question that we answer individually.

When I asked the question for myself a few years ago, I went down this list<sup>1</sup> and had to admit that I was to the point of being stuck: 

* Trying to stop repeatedly, and being unable to.
* Needing more, or progressing to worse behaviour to get the same effect.
* Developing a tolerance to the effect.
* Using the behaviour to manage emotional state. "Medicating" is often the term used when lowering your mood, but the behaviour can also be used to raise your mood. 
* Persisting despite experiencing negative consequences.

It is hard to admit that you might be stuck; there is a ton of shame around this issue that keeps men silent and keeps them from seeking help. But when you are stuck you need help, and there is help available. 

Personally, I had settled into a life of acceptance. It wasn't until a good friend shared his own story of sexual struggle, his drive to get help, and the freedom he was experiencing, that I decided life could be different for me. But it took honesty about my stuckness first. 

It is my hope to inspire you too. I'll be sharing more of my story soon on how I got help and how you can too. Stay tuned.

Cheers!
